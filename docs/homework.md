# Homework

## Overview
All homeworks will be created using RMarkdown and uploaded to Canvas as *both .html and .rmd files*. 
You are expected to mix in-line R calculations, tables, R output, and plots with text 
as appropriate. You *must* use in-line R calculations/references (e.g. with functions
like `nrow()`, `mean()`, etc.) and may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text.

Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using
sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. Use chunk options `echo` and `results`
to limit the code and output you show in the .html. Discussion of specific values should
be summarized in sentences in your text--not as printed code and output--and rounded
(for instance, using `round()`) so as not to be absurdly precise.

## Evaluation of Peer Review
For each homework assignment, completed assignments will be randomly assigned to peer
reviewers. They will provide feedback and a score between 0 and 3 points according to
the rubric below and the [peer review guidelines](http://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/docs/peer_review.html).
75% of your overall course grade comes from evaluation of homeworks.

## Grading Rubric
Homeworks will be evaluated by peers on a 0 to 3 scale. The overall scores are 
shown below with example situations in bullets below each.

0: Didn't turn anything in

1: Turned in but low effort, ignoring many directions

  * No attempt made on any one problem.
  * Attempts made on all problems but nothing worked
  * `.html` file did not knit / was not provided
  * `.Rmd` file not provided
  
2: Decent effort, followed directions with some minor issues

  * Some code fails to work, but a reasonable attempt was made.
  * `.html` file knitted but is poorly formatted
  * `.Rmd` syntax is disorganized or hard to follow
  
3: Nailed it

  * All problems answered with no errors or omissions
  * Code and output are clearly organized
  * Clever or elegant possibly solutions used

## When to Contact the Instructor
A number of situations may warrant contacting the instructor:

1. If you believe you have received an unfair peer review, you can **resubmit** your 
homework for evaluation by the instructor. The assignment will be regraded, which may
result in a higher, same, or lower grade.
2. If you wish for more feedback on a particular part of the homework, you can ask
the instructor for additional explanation *without resubmitting* during lab or over email.
3. If you receive no feedback, the instructor will provide *gentle* peer review on request.
