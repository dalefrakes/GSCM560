# Syllabus: GSCM560 - Supply Chain Modeling & Simulation
## Portland State University School of Business
## Fall 2019, Fully Online

Instructor: [Dale Frakes](mailto:dfrakes@pdx.edu)

Last Revised: 21 August 2019

## Broad Course Trajectory

Modeling & simulation are powerful tools for understanding how a system behaves in general as well as making specific predictions and exploring policy options. This course will introduce a variety of modeling and simulation techniques and how they can be used to explore a number of topics in supply chain management. By the end of the course, students should have a firm understanding of the most common modeling & simulation techniques and be able to apply these to the supply chain problems they face in their own organization. The supply chain topics have been chosen to help provide a holistic view of an organization and how supply chain intersects other parts of the organization, including product creation, demand planning, sourcing, finance, sales, and sustainability. Most of the course work will be done through lab exercises and an optional mini-project. The programming language, R, will be the tool of choice for this course though some work can be completed in Microsoft Excel as well as special purpose modeling tools.

## Assignments & Grading

This course is graded as 4 credits, Programming and Modeling & Simulation are subjects that are best learned by doing. So the emphasis of this course is on the lab exercises and a mini-project.

Graded activities are generally due on Sunday evenings at 11:59PM, PSU local time (see the course calendar for specific dates and times).

### Graded Activities

The table below shows the graded activities for the course. They are structured so students can choose which and how many of each item to complete in order to accumulate the points required to achieve their desired grade. The main flexibility is among the *Online Discussions* and *Synchronous Hangouts*. Additionally, students may opt to work on a given problem for Lab Exercise 3, or work on a *Mini-Project*, allowing them to explore a topic of interest related to supply chain modeling & simulation.

  Grade Item                    Points
  ----------------------------- ---------
  Mini-Lab: Getting Started     5
  Lab Exercise 1                20
  Lab Exercise 2                20
  Lab Exercise 3/Mini-Project   35
  Online Discussions            10
  Synchronous Hangouts          10
  TOTAL:                        **100**

### Grading Scale

  Letter Grade   Points
  -------------- ------------
  > A            92 – 100
  > A-           89 – 91.99
  > B+           86 – 88.99
  > B            82 – 85.99
  > B-           79 – 81.99
  > C+           76 – 78.99
  > C            72 – 75.99

### Explanation of Graded Activities

#### Mini-Lab

This is a simple “getting started” exercise to ensure students have access to a fully-functioning R/RStudio environment. A specification will be provided listing a set of activities to be encoded into an R-Markdown document. The RMD document and resulting HTML/PDF are to be submitted via a D2L Assignment.

#### Lab Exercises

Learning to use tools like R for modeling & simulation requires hands-on practice so these lab exercises make up a majority of the grade for the class. For each of these exercises, a template will be provided with some existing code and students will be challenged to use that code to answer questions and then build on it to complete additional functionality and answer additional questions. These exercises are designed to incorporate code and supporting text to create documents in the spirit of Reproducible Research.

The lab exercises are set up so that there is a bank of problems to choose from, categorized as “easy” (worth 1/3), “medium” (worth 2/3), and “challenging” (3/3). A student may choose to complete 3 easy problems, 1 medium and 1 easy (or another medium), or 1 challenging. In each problem, the expectation is to create a “workbook” or “markdown” document that includes code and output, along with narrative about what is happening. A key component of this is also some text about what challenges were encountered and, **very importantly**, what the student learned.

Students must use R/R-Markdown in each Lab Exercise. Excel or some other special-purpose tool may be used for a problem *with prior permission from the instructor* (though the expectation is that the data and graphics from such tools will be incorporated into an R-Markdown document).

#### Mini-Project

Students may choose to do a Mini-Project instead of Lab Exercise 3. The idea here is to creatively pursue a problem of interest, using the tools and techniques learned in the course. There are 3 deliverables related to the Mini-Project:

-   Short 1-2 paragraph project proposal, submitted in week 5 (20%)

-   Presentation (during the last Google Hangouts session) (35%)

-   Full write-up, submitted during Finals week (45%)

It’s difficult to define the scope for a mini-project but I’m looking for something that can be completed with 20-35 hours of effort over the 5 weeks available to work on it. The proposal should include a problem statement covering the modeling & simulation question to be explored, possible methods to analyze it, data sources, , and expected outcome. The presentation should be a handful of slides or similar material that can be presented to the class in 5-7 minutes. The write-up will preferably be an R-Markdown document including discussion, the analytical methods used, analysis of the methods, and discussion of the results. Including images and charts, this will probably be in the range of 10-15 pages. I will be grading on the quality of the work, not on the final outcome of the project. That is, if your stated goal was to *demonstrate X*, and carefully done modeling & simulation fails to do this, I will be grading the analysis and not the failure to *demonstrate X*.

#### Online Discussions

In 7 of the weeks, there will be a prompt in the Discussion area of D2L. The grading on these is a bit subjective but I’m looking for posts and responses that reflect some effort, particularly ones that encourage ongoing discussion for the class. To get the full 2 points, I am looking for two *effortful* posts; one that responds to the prompt and another that responds to another’s post or asks an engaging question.

There will be 7 opportunities to participate in the online discussions, but only 5 are required to achieve full points for the course.

#### Synchronous Google Hangouts

During this term we will meet 3 times via Google hangout. Please pick a slot that would work for your schedule and stay with it throughout this term.

-   Google Hangout \#1: \_\_\_\_\_ Monday or \_\_\_\_\_ Wednesday

-   Google Hangout \#2: \_\_\_\_\_ Monday or \_\_\_\_\_ Wednesday

-   Google Hangout \#3: \_\_\_\_\_ Monday or \_\_\_\_\_ Wednesday

Due to the Google hangout technology limitation, I will limit each hangout session to 20 students. Please complete the D2L survey with your top 2 slot choices based on the following Google hangout schedule by Sunday evening of the first week.

-   Slot \#1: \_\_\_\_\_ Monday 5– 6 p.m. PST

-   Slot \#2: \_\_\_\_\_ Wednesday 4– 5 p.m. PST

-   Slot \#3: \_\_\_\_\_ Monday 6:30 – 8:00 p.m. PST

Each Google Hangout session is worth 5 points towards your final grade. Only two are required to achieve full points.

#### Midterm and Final Exams

This course has no midterm and no final exam. The focus of the course is on learning through doing the lab exercises and mini-project.

## Accommodations for Learning Differences

If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this class, [register your needs] with the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)] to initiate an accommodations support process. The

DRC can be reached at (503) 725-4150 or drc@pdx.edu. Once you have coordinated with the DRC, please contact me to make sure that I have received a faculty notification letter and we can discuss your needs for the term.

PSU values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, usable, inclusive, and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me.

## Academic Integrity

Review the [Student Conduct Code] to become familiar with your rights, responsibilities and the behaviors for which a student may be subject to disciplinary action. An act of academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, [plagiarism], misrepresenting or improper/no citing that leads the instructor/viewer of content to believe that the writing and content are original to you, or unauthorized possession of examinations will automatically result in a grade of “F” for the affected assignment, and the case will be referred to university authorities. University authorities have the ability to escalate matters to the level of expulsion. Make sure you keep electronic copies of all your assignments also outside of D2L so that you can produce them should the need arise.

Many of PSU's online courses use the [Turnitin plagiarism assessment tool] to evaluate assignments. This tool checks submissions against a database of published works, as well as other students' papers. You can review your Turnitin report before submitting an assignment and make necessary revisions. If you are still unclear as to what constitutes plagiarism, please review the [PSU Library's Citation Tutorial].

## Data Privacy

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that affords students certain rights with respect to their academic records, such as “the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.” FERPA protects students from having their information disseminated to third parties without consent.

In accordance with this law, Portland State University has adopted rules to govern the gathering, use, and disclosure of student records with the aim of guaranteeing the privacy of such records. Under the Student Record rules, most of the records that the University maintains with regard to a student can only be disclosed to the student, University officials, sponsors of disbursed financial aid, or government agencies upon receipt of lawful subpoenas.

### Online Proctoring and Data Privacy

Portland State University’s School of Business uses an automated, third party, remote proctoring service to monitor and regulate student behavior during online exams. The current service employed— Proctorio—never holds unencrypted academic records. All data that enters its system has been encrypted by PSU’s learning management system (LMS) according to user roles, and can only be unlocked by authorized instructors and campus administrators within the LMS. This restricts information from being shared with users who do not possess a PSU "School Official" role, preventing unauthorized individuals and Proctorio from accessing student data.

-   Proctorio delivers all content via SSL (TLS 1.2), and their servers are compliant to PCI and HIPAA standards. Cookies used by the Services cannot be used to personally identify you.

-   Proctorio never requests disclosure of PII. When going through technical support channels, representatives see student inquiries as unique, randomized identifiers according to institution. The service is accessible through PSU’s LMS, with costs assumed by The School of Business, meaning no secondary accounts or payment information.

-   Proctorio is a Chrome extension that requires activation in order run within a section. This service only operates on specified quiz pages within the LMS.

Title IX Reporting Policy
-------------------------

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. We expect a culture of professionalism and mutual respect in our department and class. You may report any incident of discrimination or discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, to either the [Office of Equity and Compliance] or [the Office of the Dean of Student Life].

Please be aware that as a faculty member, I have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination. If preferred, you can instead share information about sexual harassment or sexual violence with a [confidential employee] who does not have this reporting responsibility. These include:

-   Women’s Resource Center (503-725-5672)

-   Queer Resource Center (503-725-9742)

-   Center for Student Health and Counseling (SHAC): 1880 SW 6th Ave, (503) 725-2800

-   Student Legal Services: 1825 SW Broadway, (SMSU) M343, (503) 725-4556

## Safe Campus Module

Portland State University desires to create a safe campus for our students. As part of that mission, PSU requires all students to take the learning module entitled *Creating a Safe Campus: Preventing Gender Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault*. For more information about Title IX, please complete the required student module [Creating a Safe Campus] in D2L.

If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate resources on PSU’s Enrollment Management & Student Affairs: Sexual Prevention & Response website at http://www.pdx.edu/sexual-assault.

## Diversity perspectives

This course’s learning objectives, learning outcomes and course content reflect a full range of perspectives in the field of “Supply chain management”.  Course readings have been selected to reflect a
diverse range of perspectives.  Issues of diversity related to “global culture and values” will be discussed throughout this course and students will learn to apply these factors in the simulation and modeling exercises.  Additionally, students will work in small groups where a diverse range of ideas can be shared.  The focus on inclusion and diversity is one of the core values of the SB and this course will provide a space for all perspectives and opinions.

## Diversity engagement

In this course, students will work with one another in small groups throughout the course to apply concepts to practice. Student solutions will then be shared in a large group discussion. The instructor
ensures that all students are welcome to contribute to the discussion and ask questions. The online classroom will offer student a number of different modalities for learning and participating (videos,
discussion board, online exams, Google Hangout, etc).
